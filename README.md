# Data-Analytics-Project-6000


## Project Overview

The objective of the project is to use 3-4 different Machine Learning models to investigate two or more datasets and uncover the hidden meaning of the data. For this project I will be focusing on two paticular fields: the first is focusing on the wealth & rent cost distribution across America and the second is the [cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=021). The data for the cost of living will be pulled from numbeo.com. The data for the wealth distribution and the cost of housing will be pulled from the [census data collected](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) these past century (2020 - 1920). This means there will be missing data from previous decades but that will be handled during the implemenetation phase of the project. The second dataset will be data collected on the cost of living essentials such as the average amount an American Citizen spends on groceries, clothes, health care. From there the two data sets will be combined and we will generate a two new ratios: the first is the amount of income spent on rent and the second is the amount spent on living essentials. 

Based off of this we should see an linear increase in each section, as inflation gross we see an increase in income to combat it. If the cost of living increases we should also see a linear increase to income.
