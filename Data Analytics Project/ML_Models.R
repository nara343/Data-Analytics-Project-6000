# ML Models 



#### Linear Regression ####
# Apply PCA Analysis
# Using Cost of Living and Income data predict how much rent would be for each county

#### Similar to above but use housing and Cost of Living #### 


#### Clustering ####
# (Income and Housing Data) Using the histogram percentages can we predict what bracket each person is in
# Using the average rent cost a year and try to figure it out from there. 



#### Creating 
# Random Forest, or Regression Tree 
# (Housing, Income, and Cost of Living) ML identifying where someone may live based off the numbers that have been presented 
# by the census, this could be a decision tree or a random forest tree 

# Linear Regression predicting rent cost in each county based
# We will figure this one out
